# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering Projects
There are different types of dataset on which I do Hands-On for better understanding the concept of Feature Engineering and EDA
This repository contains multiple projects where I have performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Feature Engineering on real-world datasets such as Zomato, Black Friday Sales, and Flight Price Prediction.

The goal of these projects is to analyze raw datasets, extract meaningful insights, and build a structured dataset ready for Machine Learning models.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Included
# 1. Zomato Data Analysis

Objective: Analyze restaurant data to understand cuisines, pricing, ratings, and customer preferences.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning (handling null values, duplicates, inconsistent entries).

EDA with visualizations (top cuisines, city-wise ratings, cost distribution).

Feature engineering (encoding categorical features, extracting price categories, creating rating bins).

Insights: Identified most popular cuisines, cost vs. rating correlation, and top-performing cities.

# 2. Black Friday Sales Analysis

Objective: Understand customer purchasing patterns during Black Friday sales.

Key Steps:

Data preprocessing (missing values, categorical encoding).

EDA (age group vs. purchase, gender vs. spending, product categories).

Feature engineering (customer segments, product popularity scores).

Insights: Found customer segments with the highest spending, product categories with strong sales, and gender/age-based trends.

# 3. Flight Price Prediction (EDA + Feature Engineering)

Objective: Analyze flight booking data and prepare features for price prediction models.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning (date-time conversion, handling missing values).

Feature engineering (extracting day, month, duration, total stops, airline encoding).

EDA (airline vs. price, route analysis, seasonal price variations).

Insights: Observed pricing patterns based on airlines, stops, duration, and time of booking.

# ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used
